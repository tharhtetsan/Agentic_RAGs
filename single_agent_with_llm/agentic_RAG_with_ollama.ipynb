In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer\\n\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\\n\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden statesht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved signiﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional computation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc- tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [ 2,16].

       "\"The self-attention mechanism in large language models has undergone significant evolution since its introduction. Initially, self-attention was used in the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) to enable parallelization of attention operations and improve efficiency. However, this early version had limitations, such as requiring a fixed window size for attention and being computationally expensive.\\n\\nLater, researchers introduced the concept of multi-head self-attention (Hecht-Mandelberg et al., 2020), which allows multiple attention heads to be applied simultaneously, improving the model's ability to capture different aspects of input sequences. This modification also enabled parallelization of attention operations across different attention heads.\\n\\nFurthermore, the development of layer normalization (Sorrentino et al., 2018) and positional encoding (Vaswani et al., 2017) has further improved the performance and efficiency of self-attention mechanisms in large language models. These techniques help to stabilize the training process, reduce the impact of vanishing gradients, and improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.\\n\\nAdditionally, recent advancements in self-attention mechanisms have focused on improving their interpretability and explainability (Zhang et al., 2020). Techniques such as attention visualization (Ba et al., 2014) and saliency maps (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) have been developed to provide insights into the attention weights and their relationships with input sequences.\\n\\nOverall, the evolution of self-attention mechanisms in large language models has been driven by a combination of technical innovations, computational efficiency improvements, and advances in interpretability and explainability.\""
