      "This makes it more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\n",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model\n"

      "This makes it more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\n",

      "LLM is a type of artificial intelligence model that uses natural language processing to generate human-like text. It works by taking in a sequence of words and predicting the next word in the sequence, based on the context of the previous words.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAG is a framework that combines LLM with reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance on a specific task. In RAG, the LLM is used to generate a sequence of words, and the reinforcement learning algorithm is used to evaluate the generated sequence and provide feedback to the model.\n",

      "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how LLM works in RAG:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Text Input**: The user provides a text input to the RAG system.\n",
      "2. **LLM Generation**: The LLM generates a sequence of words based on the input text.\n",
      "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The reinforcement learning algorithm evaluates the generated sequence and provides feedback to the LLM.\n",
      "4. **Model Update**: The LLM updates its parameters based on the feedback from the reinforcement learning algorithm.\n",
      "5. **Iteration**: Steps 2-4 are repeated until the model converges or a stopping criterion is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LLM in RAG uses a combination of techniques such as masked language modeling, next sentence prediction, and token classification to generate high-quality text.
